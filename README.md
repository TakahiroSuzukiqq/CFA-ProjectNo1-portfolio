# CFA Project No1    
  This project is my first Coderfactory major projecet using Ruby on Rails.  
  In this project I created my portfolio but this is a bit later recreated [my new portfolio in here](https://github.com/TakahiroSuzukiqq/CFA-Portfolio).  
  In this portfolio, I just used my basic Ruby, CSS and HTML knowledge to create.

# <a name="section2"> Issue & Futrure plan  
  I just kept these issues as they were. I fixed similar issues with my future project e.g. : [my new portfolio](https://github.com/TakahiroSuzukiqq/CFA-Portfolio).    
 * The pictures are fixed with `px` so when trying to see different size of screen, it looks ugly.  
 * Indentaiton and refactoring were too bad.
